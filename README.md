THIS WAS A COLLEGE PROJECT. IT WAS ORIGINALLY COMPILED BY A CUSTOM C++ SUBSET DEDICATED COMPILER.

## Program

It's supposed to be an app to sell and distribute medicines with drones that use a way too sophisticated algorithm to be written by a junior student. The interface is unique for users and admins alike.  
You won't be able to compile this with any known compiler, but you can run it.
